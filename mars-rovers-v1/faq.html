            <h2>1. How is Sojourner different from Curiosity and Perseverance?</h2>
                <p>Sojourner was a small technology demo weighing only 23 lbs, while Curiosity and Perseverance are car-sized, 
                   nuclear-powered science labs capable of drilling, imaging, and performing complex chemistry tests.</p>
            <h2>2. Why does NASA send rovers to Mars instead of humans?</h2>
                <p>Rovers are far safer and less expensive. They can survive harsh conditions, operate for years, and prepare 
                   the groundwork for future human missions by studying terrain, weather, radiation, and potential resources.</p>
            <h2>3. How do rovers communicate with Earth?</h2>
                <p>Rovers send data using NASA’s Deep Space Network, usually relaying through orbiters like Mars Reconnaissance 
                   Orbiter for faster transmission.</p>
            <h2>4. What happens to a rover when its mission ends?</h2>
                <p>Once a rover loses power, gets stuck, or can no longer communicate, it remains on the Martian surface 
                    permanently as a historical artifact of human exploration.</p>
            <h2>5. How long does it take for a signal to reach a rover on Mars?</h2>
                <p>Depending on the positions of Earth and Mars, radio signals take 4 to 24 minutes to travel one way.
                     Because of this delay, the rovers can’t be driven like remote-control cars.</p>
            <h2>6. How do rovers survive the cold on Mars?</h2>
                <p>Curiosity and Perseverance use heat from their RTG power systems to warm internal components. Sojourner used 
                    small heaters and insulation to maintain safe temperatures.</p>
            <h2>7. What kind of cameras do the rovers use?</h2>
                <p>Rovers carry multiple camera systems including navigation cameras, hazard cameras, science cameras, and high-resolution 
                    imaging systems like Mastcam and SuperCam.</p>
            <h2>8. What is a “sol”? </h2>
                <p>A sol is a Martian day, lasting about 24 hours and 39 minutes. Rover missions are scheduled using sols instead of Earth days.</p>
            <h2>9. How does Perseverance store samples for future return?</h2>
                <p>Perseverance uses a robotic drill to collect rock cores and seal them in airtight titanium tubes. These tubes will later be collected 
                    by a future NASA/ESA mission and returned to Earth.</p>
            <h2>10. How long will Curiosity and Perseverance continue operating?</h2>     
                <p>As long as their instruments, wheels, and power systems remain healthy. RTGs provide steady energy for well over a decade, so both rovers 
                    could operate for many years.</p>
            <h2>11. Why is Mars called the Red Planet?</h2>
                <p>Mars appears red because its surface is covered in iron-rich dust that oxidizes, or “rusts,” giving the planet its reddish color.</p>
            <h2>12. Does Mars have seasons?</h2>
                <p>Yes. Because Mars is tilted on its axis like Earth, it has spring, summer, fall, and winter. However, its seasons last twice as long, since Mars takes 687 Earth days to orbit the Sun.</p>
            <h2>13. Does Mars have moons?</h2>
                <p>Mars has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids.</p>
            <h2>How far is Mars from Earth?</h2>
                <p>The distance varies because both planets orbit the Sun. The average distance is about 140 million miles, but at closest approach it can be as little as 34 million miles.</p>
