            <h2>Sojourner</h2>
            <p>Sojourner was NASA’s first successful Mars rover, sent as part of the 1997 Mars Pathfinder mission to test whether a 
                mobile robot could explore the Martian surface. Designed primarily as a technology demonstration, its mission was to 
                analyze rocks and soil while proving that a small, wheeled rover could safely navigate another planet. Although expected
                 to last only 7 sols, Sojourner far exceeded expectations by operating for 83 sols, returning invaluable engineering 
                 and scientific data.
            </p>

            <p>After launching on December 4, 1996, and landing in Ares Vallis on July 4, 1997, Sojourner used its Alpha Proton X-Ray 
                Spectrometer to study the chemistry of rocks like “Barnacle Bill” and “Yogi.” It sent back over 550 images, measured 
                soil mechanics, and provided the first real demonstration of autonomous mobility on Mars. Its six-wheel rocker-bogie 
                suspension, hazard-avoidance system, and lightweight design laid the foundation for every Mars rover that followed, 
                proving that mobile exploration was the future of Martian science.</p>

        <section id="curiosity-intro" class ="container">
            <h2>Curiosity</h2>
            <p> Curiosity’s mission is to determine whether Mars ever offered conditions capable of supporting microbial life. Launched
                on November 26, 2011, and landing in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012, Curiosity used NASA’s groundbreaking Sky Crane system to 
                touch down safely on the surface. Its car-sized frame carries a full onboard chemistry laboratory, allowing it to drill into rocks,
                vaporize samples with a laser, and analyze minerals to understand the planet’s ancient environments.
            </p>
            <p>Curiosity’s discoveries have fundamentally changed our understanding of Mars. It found strong evidence that Gale Crater 
                once housed long-lasting freshwater lakes and streams, detected organic molecules in ancient rocks, and measured 
                methane variations that may hint at geological or biological processes. Powered by a plutonium-based RTG and equipped 
                with instruments like SAM, CheMin, and Mastcam, Curiosity continues to explore Mount Sharp, revealing layer after layer 
                of Mars’s climate history and ancient habitability.

        <section id="perseverance-intro" class ="container">
            <h2>Perseverance</h2>
            <p>Perseverance is NASA’s most advanced rover, launched on July 30, 2020, and landed in Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021.
                 Its primary mission is to search for signs of ancient microbial life and collect scientifically valuable rock samples 
                 for a future return to Earth. Jezero Crater was chosen because it once hosted a large river delta—an ideal environment 
                 for preserving biosignatures. Perseverance uses enhanced autonomous driving and a suite of highly sensitive science tools to investigate these ancient deposits.
            </p>
            <p>Since landing, Perseverance has made major accomplishments including detecting organic molecules, studying ancient lake 
               sediments, and collecting dozens of sample cores for the Mars Sample Return campaign. It also carried the Ingenuity 
               helicopter, which became the first aircraft to fly on another planet, and demonstrated MOXIE, an experiment that 
               successfully made oxygen from Mars’s atmosphere. With instruments like SHERLOC, PIXL, and SuperCam, along with a robust 
               sampling system and RTG power source, Perseverance is advancing the search for past life and preparing the way for future human exploration.</p>

            <h2>Overview of Mars Rover Evolution</h2>
            <p>Over the past few decades, NASA’s Mars rovers have grown dramatically in capability, sophistication, and scientific ambition. Beginning with the small, experimental Sojourner rover, engineers proved that a mobile robot could operate on the Martian surface. 
               This success paved the way for larger and more advanced missions like Curiosity, which introduced powerful laboratory-grade instruments to study the planet’s geology and potential habitability. Building on that legacy, Perseverance represents the next leap 
               forward with technologies designed to search for signs of ancient life and collect samples for eventual return to Earth. To better understand how these rovers differ in design and capability, the table below compares their key specifications side by side.</p>
