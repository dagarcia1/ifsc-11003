  <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is a strategy that ensures all users receive the same basic content regardless of the platform used to view it. There are also content modifications to enhance the user experience, 
    provided the platform can support them. The reason this strategy is so important in modern-day web development is that websites are used across a multitude of platforms (such as tablets, phones, and refrigerators) 
    rather than just on computers as in the past. Every platform has different levels of capabilities for handling a website. This creates an overwhelming need to accommodate these different platforms through progressive enhancement, 
    ensuring all users can access the same basic content. If we do not follow this strategy, older platform versions become obsolete, potentially affecting website usage and profitability.

  <h3>Mars Rover Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
  <p>Creating this project really showed me how much time and effort go into building a simple website. This experience helped me build confidence in HTML and CSS. When I started, I was overwhelmed, just staring at the blank screen and unsure where to begin. Taking the project in segments, as you explained in class, helped me get started. From there, I was able to build upon each part, and things started to click. It was exciting to see everything we learned this semester compiled into a website I created.</p>

  <p>My experience in your class this semester was excellent overall. Your lectures were clear and easy to understand, and the hands-on learning matched my learning style. I look forward to taking more courses with you and may even consider changing my major to web design if cybersecurity does not work out.</p>

  <p>What I did well was create a cohesive design and layout, even with the embedded web form, and usable links throughout the website. If I had to start over, I would begin the project sooner. I underestimated how long it would take to create.</p>

  <p>The feedback I received on my draft was that there were spelling/punctuation errors, add a paragraph before the comparison table, space out the FAQ questions, and add some more info to the comparison table than just the specs, but more of an overview of the rovers. I choose to apply the recommended changes because you can't have any spelling/punctuation errors on a website; they would affect the website's credibility with users. Next, I added a paragraph before the comparison chart to help segue the user to the table, 
    so it wouldn't feel so disconnected or abrupt, and to give the table a clearer purpose. I spaced out the FAQ questions to make them easier to read for all users. Lastly, I added more info to the table for users who didn’t want to read the paragraphs and wanted a quick snapshot about the rovers.</p>
